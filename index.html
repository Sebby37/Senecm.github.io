                <br>
                My name is Ulysses, and I am a striving author. I, after many destined to fail attempts at creating an enjoyable novel, 
                have created an alternate history world, from which I write short stories. All my stories are completley free, for all to enjoy.

                    New to 'The Xuantong Legacy'?
                    Read one of my novels, but dont understand the background?
                <br>
                    Not a problem! This is the main sight for the lore and history behind my creations, and the world they reside in! Not to mention all my Novella, in pdf format!
                    I have composed a document concisivley explaining all this to you. And it will be realising soon!
                <br>
                    Dont worry though! You do not need to know the lore behind it to understand and enjoy the story for the majority of my works. However, some stories directly continue and build off of the lore, so I highly suggest you read the lore document.
